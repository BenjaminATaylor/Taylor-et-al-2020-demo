# Taylor-et-al-2020b

Machine learning code for Taylor et al "The molecular basis of socially-mediated phenotypic plasticity in a eusocial paper wasp".

# System requirements

Requires **R** version v3.6+ with packages *tidyverse*, *e1071*, *DESeq2*, *limma* & *pracma* installed.

Tested in **Ubuntu** v18.04.4 using **R** v3.6.3 running in **RStudio** v1.3.959.

# Installation guide

We provide thee sets of gene expression data for use with the demo code:

  * *counts_raw* is the full set of gene expression data generated for the experiment
  * *counts_clean* is a 'cleaned' set of genes from which rows representing genes with low expression across all samples have been removed
  * *counts_clean_subsample* is a smaller set of 1000 genes randomly picked from those in *counts_clean*; we recommend using this smaller dataset to reduce computation times when testing the demo.
